Assignment 2 guidelines and regulations:
1. This is an individual assignment. Each student must do the assignment by themselves. You might seek conceptual help from your classmates, but your code must be your own.
2. Any sort of plagiarism (code copied from a classmate or Google, Chegg, ChatGPT or any other website) will be strictly dealt with. If found guilty of plagiarism, the student will be awarded an F grade for the course and reported to the ECE department and the Proctor's office for further disciplinary action as per the NSU Code of Conduct. If any plagiarism is caught, you will be awarded an F grade for the whole course. Its better to get bad marks than to get an F. 
3. There are 6 questions and each question holds 10 marks.
Submission Guidelines:

The name of this folder will be your name along with your NSU ID. For example, the name of the folder should be something like this "Shafayat Oshman 1211211042". In this folder, place your pdf file. Convert this folder into a zip file using Winrar or other software and name the zip file in the same format "Shafayat Oshman 1211211042". Submit the .zip file through Canvas.
