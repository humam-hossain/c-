# Problems

In this assignment, you will compare the performance of three sorting algorithms based on different datasets. You must follow the following procedures. 

1. Create at least 4 datasets of different sizes. Generate the numbers randomly using rand(). One of the dataset must contain at least 100,000 values. 

2. Implement the Bubble, Selection, Insertion and Merge sort algorithms.

3. Execute these algorithms on all datasets and measure their performance in terms of execution time. Use time_t variable as shown in the class.

4. Prepare and submit a report that includes the pseudocode of all algorithms and shows the comparison table and the corresponding graph showing the performance. Your report must have a cover page and the following sections.

     Section 1: Pseudocodes

     Section 2: Performance Comparison Table

     Section 3: Performance Evaluation Graphs

     Section 4: Conclusion (write your learnings through this assignment in your own words)

5. Also, submit your codes. You can submit the assignment only once. 

6. File name should be - <your-student-id>_A01.docx and <your-student-id>_A01.cpp 

This assignment will be considered as one of the Quizzes worth of 15 marks.
